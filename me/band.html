		<h2 id="basementjams">Basement Jams</h2>

			<p>My experience with my current band began all the way back in grade 4 when I joined <i>Teal Steel</i> as a drummer and met my now best friend Isaac, who played guitar. We played in <i>Teal Steel</i> up until the pandemic in 2020, where we thought the band wouldn't last. Instead of calling it quits, Isaac and I began jamming for hours on end in my basement, leading to an albums worth of songs. With this we renamed ourselves <b>The Radio Relics</b></p>

			<p>Recorded in my basement and mixed at NYU, "Out There" was our debut album which we released in September of 2024. Along with promoting our recordings, we wanted to prove our abilities on stage, so we brought on two of our friends from the DC area, Malcolm and Jonah, who took up the roles of guitar and bass respectively. Fortunately, 3/4 of us wanted to attend NYU, so we brought the band up to New York.</p>

			<p>Since getting to college, we've added a new fourth member on guitar, Max, who also happens to be from DC originally and we've played almost 30 shows in the past 2 years between New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and DC. We're planning on releasing another album in the spring and continuing to play our hearts out on stage in 2026.</p>
