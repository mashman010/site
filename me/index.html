			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

				<p>My name is Matthew Ashman. I'm a student at NYU but first and foremost, I'm a musician, along with a producer, and an avid lover of music as well. This website is a mini walk-through of different phases in my career so far and how they relate to one another. </p>

			<h2 id="earlyyears">Early Years</h2>

				<p>My dedication to playing and performing music begann with my love for it at a young age. By the time I was 10 I could easily name any of the 500 songs that were played on the classic rock radio in DC. The biggest influence of them all was my admiration for the Beatles. to this day, my party trick is that I can name any beatles song given a 1 second clip from anywhere. I like to call it "Beatles Roulette"</p>

			<h2 id="gettingserious">Getting Serious</h2>

				<p>Throughout high school, and particularly during the COVID-19 lockdowns, I began to write and record music obsessively. My parents saw this and suggested I try attending an NYU summer program at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. After this, I knew that New York was exactly where I needed to be, and I think it's where I'll be staying.</p>
