		<h2 id="liveshows">Live Shows</h2>

			<p>The energy that comes from a recording is almost directly correlated to how the band performs. This is even more important for live shows. The best bands were always the ones who could inspire emotions on a stage. The Radio Relics are a live band through and through. We love playing rooms large and small to people who know us or are about to.</p>

		<h2 id="thefans">The Fans</h2>

			<p>Since high school, our pool of fans have slowly grown from our family, to our friends we made and invited to backyard shows, to our first small venues, and now to the large venues across New York. </p>
